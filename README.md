## ðŸ“Š Iris Dataset EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris flower dataset using Python, pandas, and matplotlib. The Iris dataset is a well-known multi-class classification dataset that contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample includes four numeric features â€” sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In this notebook, we load the dataset, compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), and visualize each feature individually using customized histograms. These visualizations help us understand the distribution and spread of the features, and provide insight into how different species vary by their measurements.

This project is ideal for beginners learning how to perform data analysis, understand numeric distributions, and practice visual storytelling using Python libraries.
